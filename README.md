# Tennis_Ace_Project
 
This is a project launched at Codecademy and it is a part of Data Scientist Career Path.

I will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, I will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.
